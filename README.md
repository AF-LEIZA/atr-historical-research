# atr-historical-research

## Purpose of the repository

This repository coveres different aspects of Automated Text Recognition (ATR) in Historical Research from post-processing scans of historical documents to OCR/HWR technology and improving text recognition with AI. Apart from code samples, the repository will also include short instructions and sample workflows, all with a special focus on pre-modern history.

## Recommended tutorials and readings on Zotero

To share tutorials and readings that I found helpful in my own work, I have created the [ATR History group library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5646174/atr_history/), which will be expanded over time.
