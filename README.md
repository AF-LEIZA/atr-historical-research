# atr-historical-research

## Purpose of the repository

This repository coveres different aspects of Automated Text Recognition (ATR) in Historical Research from post-processing scans of historical documents to OCR/HWR technology and improving text recognition with AI. Apart from code samples, the repository will also include short instructions and sample workflows, all with a special focus on historical documents.

## Workshops / collaborations

Over time, materials in this repository will also be used and / or co-created in workshops with colleagues from the digital humanities and historical disciplines. We will experiment with documents in different languages, especially exploring solutions for texts in Dutch, German and French.

## Recommended tutorials and readings on Zotero

To share (video) tutorials and readings that colleagues and I found helpful in our own work, I have created the [ATR History group library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5646174/atr_history/), which we will update continuously.
