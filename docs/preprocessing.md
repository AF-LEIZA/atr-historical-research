# Challenges of image processing before OCR/HWR

The first step for any form of computational text analysis is to create high-quality machine-readable text, but even the most advanced tools for handwriting or optical character recognition struggle with low-quality scans or scans of materials that are damaged, low in contrast, or visually complex. Automated image processing can improve the final results, but there also is a danger of over-engineering the process. 

## Test-case 1: human-written script for basic noise reduction and contrast enhancement

## Test-case 2: script including GenAI recommendations for complex image processing
