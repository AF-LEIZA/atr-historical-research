# Strategies for optimising layout recognition

## Digitisation as part of the transcription

As Koen Hufkens explained in his talk at IEG Mainz on 6 February 2025, digitisation is already part of the transcription and those who are making their own photos or scans of sources should pay attention to the following aspects:

- experiment with different (paper) backgrounds, especially when paper is slightly transparent, gray or black backgrounds may work better than white backgrounds
- consider preparing a grid for precise document alignment
- consider creating a frame or passepartout for documents of different sizes
