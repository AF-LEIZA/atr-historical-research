# Challenges for automated OCR/HWR postprocessing

OCR results, especially for languages other than English, still contain many mistakes. One option to reduce these errors is to train better models for specific use cases, but this is often not possible. Automated postprocessing of the plain text generated by the OCR tool is another option, and several researchers are actively exploring the role that AI / ML can play in this process.

## Test-case 1: using a Large Language Model (LLM) for the correction of spelling mistakes / misidentified characters

## Test-case 2: using a Large Language Model (LLM) for Named Entity Recognition (NER)
