# Useful research software

In our Bring Your Own Data Lab workshop in February 2025, we discussed that (high-quality) OCR may not be necessary for all research purposes and that sometimes image annotation
(of the source scans) and digital aids to speed-up annotation writing can already bring many projects a big step forward. Below is a (far from complete) list of recommended research software that you could check out:

## Tools for image manipulation

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) (free and open source image editor)
- [https://imagej.net/](open source software for processing and analysing scientific images)

## Scanning for mobile devices

- [OpenScan](https://github.com/ethereal-developers/OpenScan) (open-source, privacy-friendly Document Scanner app)

## Document / image annotation and qualitative analysis

- [cvat.ai](https://www.cvat.ai/) (data engine for machine learning to annotate images)
- [Atlas.ti](https://atlasti.com/) (tool for qualitative data analysis, including options to create visualisations based on tags and free text)
- [NVivo](https://lumivero.com/products/nvivo/) (qualiative research software)

## GDPR-compliant speech-to-text tools

- [noScribe](https://github.com/kaixxx/noScribe) (uses OpenAIs Whisper for automated audio transcription) 
- [aTrain](https://github.com/JuergenFleiss/aTrain) (GUI tool for offline transcription of speech recordings, including speaker diarisation)
