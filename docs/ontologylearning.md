# Graph-LLMs and ontology learning

This topic came up in our discussions during the BYODL workshop in Mainz in February 2025. Several participants were not only interested in using OCR for plain text generation but also interested
in combining OCR with an automated generation of semantic triples.

Unfortunately, we did not have an opportunity to pursue this further during our meeting -- but more information will follow soon.
