# Working with your own user data

The main branch of this repository contains two empty directories for user data in JPG and TXT formats, which you can use to link your sources to our scripts.
Please make sure that filenames are short and do not contain special characters. Avoid spaces where possible. When testing our scripts in temporary environments such as BinderHub, it is also recommended to keep the data samples small.

For the processing of larger data sets, please consider running our scripts locally (e.g. within Anaconda) or within an institutional research infrastructure (such as a JupyterHub hosted by your home university).
